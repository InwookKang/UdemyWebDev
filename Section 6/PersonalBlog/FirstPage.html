			<p>Learning about HTML antonomy</p>
			<p>I am currently doing my Laundry and Learning about <em>HTML</em> using <strong>Udemy</strong>. So far, I am liking the course. It is going at a good pace. Things I got done this morning: </p>

			<!-- Ordered List -->
			<!-- By itself it is nothing. It needs list elements in it -->
			<ol>
				<li>Dishes (Been in the sink for two days...)</li>
				<li>Got Change for Laundry</li>
				<li>Got <em>Best Bagel in Town</em>(Club Turkey BLT) wasn't too bad.</li>
				<li>Found <strong>$40</strong> in my bag!</li>
			</ol>
			<!-- span (Inline Level Element) is a generic group box for inline -->
			<p>My <span>Girlfriend is moving today</span> and I feel bad for not being able to help her. Since I'm at Binghamton, NY, it is hard to me to see her often now. :( Somethings that I Plan on doing today: </p>
			<!-- Unordered List -->
			<!-- a (Inline Level Element) is called anchor tag. Text inside becomes a hyperlink -->
			<!-- The link needs to include http://. Otherwise it will be think it is a local file. -->
			<ul>
				<li>Dinner with <a href="http://www.uic.com">UIC</a> co-workers</li>
				<li>Make Kimchi Chigae</li>
				<li>Clean House a bit more
					<!-- You can also do List inside a List -->
					<ul>
						<li>Take out Garbage</li>
						<li>Wipe down some dust</li>
						<li>Clean out Computer Desk</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Well, since this is my first Web Page for my "Blog", I will include many HTML tags within this page. Below is using HTML Table tag: </p>
			<h3>Front End And Back End Sthuffs</h3>
			<!-- Table tag creates a table and will need tr (Row), th (Column Name), td (Data) tags to create a table -->
			<table border="1">
				<!-- thead and tbody (HTML5) are used to disquinish between table header and table body -->
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Front End</th> <!-- Table Header  -->
						<th>Back End</th>			
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>HTML</td>
						<td>PHP</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>CSS</td>
						<td>Database</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JavaScript</td>
						<td>Algorithms</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> </td>
						<td>Queries</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

			<p>So to quickly recap, yesterday I have finished my course on HTML and now I will be moving on to Lecture 41 in Section 5. This Unit will be on CSS and integrating CSS with HTML. If we were to compare HTML, CSS and Javascript with english language, HTML will be like our "nouns", CSS will be like our "adjectives" and Javascript will be like "verbs"</p>
			
			<p>Below are the sections that will be covered: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define the "General Rule" of CSS</li>
				<li>Correctly include CSS in your HTML files</li>
				<li>Select Elements by tag name, class and ID</li>
				<li>Style elements with basic properties like color and background</li>
				<li>Use Chrome CSS Inspector to debug HTML and CSS</li>
				<li>Exercise: CSS Selector Scavenger Hunt</li>
			</ul>

			<p>CSS Selectors</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Element (ex. h1, p, li)</li>
				<li>ID</li>
				<li>Class</li>
			</ul>
